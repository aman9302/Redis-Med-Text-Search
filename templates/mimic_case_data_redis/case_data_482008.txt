Case Management Initial Assessment
   The patient is a 46 year-old man with end stage HIV and HCV who
   presents with nausea and vomiting and hyponatremia of 115.
   The patient lives alone in housing subsidized by the [**Hospital1 **] AIDS
   Network ([**Female First Name (un) **]).  He has been functionally independent until the few days
   prior to presentation to [**Hospital1 19**].  He does not have much in the way of
   close supports on island other than the staff of [**Female First Name (un) **] according to his
   community case manager at the agency, [**Doctor First Name 7158**] Infantiedes, who can be
   reached at either her office at ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 9740**] or on her cell at ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 9741**].
   [**Doctor First Name 7158**] reports that she has been working with the patient
s PCP to
   find appropriate palliative care/hospice services for the patient.  She
   was due to discuss options with the patient when she visited him last
   Friday, but he was ill at the time and [**Doctor First Name 7158**] took him to [**Hospital1 9742**].  [**Doctor First Name 7158**] is still searching for appropriate
   services for the patient, including a possible residential hospice
   placement, but she indicates that there are not a lot of such services
   available on island.
   This nurse case manager is not able to meet with the patient at this
   time as he is out of the ICU for a gallbladder ultrasound, but will try
   to meet with him later today before he is transferred to the floor.  He
   has been called out of the ICU but does yet not have a bed assignment
   at this time.
   The patient
s post-acute care needs remain undetermined at this time,
   and this NCM will continue to follow the patient while in the ICU for
   discharge planning assistance.  Please page for any questions/concerns.
