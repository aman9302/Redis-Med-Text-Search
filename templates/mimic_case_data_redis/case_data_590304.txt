Case Management Discharge Plan
 Home with Hospice
   The patient is a 64 y/o M with PMHx of stage IV colon adenocarcinoma
   who presented with leukocytosis, abnormal LFTs and diffuse C. diff
   positive diarrhea.
   This nurse case manager was paged to the ICU to arrange home hospice
   services for this patient who was active with the [**Hospital3 **] VNA prior
   to admission.  Given that the patient needs a hospital bed at home
   prior to his arrival, he will be admitted directly to hospice services
   with the Hospice of the [**Hospital3 **] (HSS) which is an affiliate of the
   [**Hospital3 **] VNA rather than resume his previous skilled nursing
   services with a transition to hospice.  Hospice of the [**Hospital3 **] will
   arrange to have a hospital bed delivered this morning.
   This nurse case manager spoke with [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2834**] at HSS at ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 7706**]
   and she confirmed that the agency can admit the patient to hospice
   services today.  Their fax number is ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 7707**].  The hospice
   comfort pack orders have been faxed to HSS at this number.
   An ambulance will be arranged for the patient
s transportation home.  A
   MA Comfort Care/DNR form should accompany the patient.
   Once the hospice agency has confirmed the delivery of the patient
   hospital bed and comfort pack medications, this NCM will inform the
   [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] team.  In the meantime, please page for any questions/concerns or
   additional case management assistance for this patient.
