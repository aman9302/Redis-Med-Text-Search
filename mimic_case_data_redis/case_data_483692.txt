Case Management Note
   The patient is a 68 yo M with PMH of stage III squamous cell throat CA
   admitted for PNA, who was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] from the oncology
   service for hypoxic respiratory distress.  He now has a tracheostomy
   and needs pulmonary rehab.
   This nurse case manager spoke with the patient
s wife to discuss
   post-acute care options prior to the patient receiving a tracheostomy.
    Mrs. [**Known lastname 10068**] requested referrals to [**Hospital3 **] and to [**Hospital **]
   at [**Location (un) 221**], which is a skilled nursing facility.  This NCM informed
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 10068**] that the patient is likely to require post-acute care at
   an LTACH vs an acute rehab facility given his respiratory difficulties
   at the time.  Now that he has a new trach, it is unlikely that any [**Hospital1 238**]
   will be able to offer a bed.  This NCM explained what an LTACH is and
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 10068**] agreed to a referral to [**Hospital1 189**].  The [**Hospital1 **] screener
   will screen for both SRH and [**Hospital1 189**], and will forward the screen to
   Shaughnessey-[**Hospital1 2679**] in [**Hospital1 190**] as a back-up option.
   We are currently awaiting a decision from SRH, [**Hospital1 189**] and SKR.
   Decisions are expected by [**10-5**].  This NCM will continue to follow and
   assist with discharge planning.
